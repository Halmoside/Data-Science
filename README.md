# Introduction
Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that involves the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data in order to extract insights and knowledge from it. It combines the disciplines of statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain expertise to create models that can be used to make informed decisions.

This repository aims to provide resources and projects related to Data Science, ranging from introductory tutorials to advanced projects.
# Getting Started
To get started with Data Science, you should have a basic understanding of statistics, mathematics, and programming. You can start by learning a programming language like Python or R, and familiarizing yourself with the various libraries and tools that are commonly used in Data Science.

Some of the commonly used tools and libraries in Data Science include:
1. Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow .
2. R: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, caret, shiny .

# Projects
This repository contains a number of projects related to Data Science, ranging from beginner to advanced level. Each project comes with a detailed README file, explaining the problem statement, the data used, and the approach taken to solve the problem.

Some of the projects included in this repository are:
1. Titanic Survival Prediction: A beginner-level project that involves predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning algorithms.
2. Customer Segmentation: An intermediate-level project that involves segmenting customers based on their behavior and demographics.
3. Stock Price Prediction: An advanced-level project that involves predicting the stock prices of a company using time-series analysis and machine learning.
